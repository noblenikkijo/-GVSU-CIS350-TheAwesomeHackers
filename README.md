## The Awesome Hackers

Our intention with this project was meant to instruct and educate users on the dangers of phishing attacks; thus, we created a phishing attack of our own. Our phishing attack can be used by schools, businesses, etc to demonstrate the dangers associated with phishing attacks such as having their data and/or money stolen. We created a phishing email that is a representation of what you might actually see and this email links to our website. With full functionally, the email link would bring you to a lockdown browser by downloading the malware/ransomware to lockdown the computer. However, you must go through our installation instructions for the Safe Exam Browser in order to demonstrate our program. After running the program, you must go through our attack learning about the dangers and risks of phishing in order to exit the demonstration.
