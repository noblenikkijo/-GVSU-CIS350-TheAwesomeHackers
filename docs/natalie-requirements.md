# Functional: 
* The background color for the GUI once the link is clicked shall be black with a hexadecimal RGB color value of 000000.
* The program shall utilize the use of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) which the users will interact with as the backbone of the phishing attack. 
* The program shall open the GUI when the phishing link is clicked on in the email or when the flash drive is inserted into the computer.


# Non-Functional: 
* The program shall be adaptable across systems so moving from one OS to another OS, such as Mac to Windows, does not create any problems.
* The GUI should open within less than 3 seconds once the phishing link has been clicked or the flash drive has been inserted. 
* The user shall interact with the GUI for at most 30 minutes if they are unable to activate the kill switch.
