# Introduction

  Our intention with this project is to learn how to best defend against cyber security threats by intimidating attackers and learning their methods. We will try a variety of methods such as fishing, a USB, and other well known methods to deploy out virus. This virus will be both a instant display on the screen as well as track the user to play a video upon a specific web entry.
  Overall we plan on making learning how best to create a virus that both instantly displays as well as remains in the background.
