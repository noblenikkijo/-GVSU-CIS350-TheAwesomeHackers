Team Name: The Awesome Hackers 

Team Members: Nikki Noble, Zoe Oliver, Ian Malinowski, and Natalie Kline

# Introduction

Our intention with this project is to learn how to best defend against cyber security threats by intimidating attackers and learning their methods. In order to accomplish this, we will try a variety of different methods such as fishing, a USB, and other well known methods to deploy our virus. This virus will be an instant display on the screen that will track the user to play a video upon a specific web entry.

Essentially, the basis of our idea is to create a rickroll. Overall, we plan on learning how to best create a virus that instantly displays on the screen and then is something the user will interact with and as the user is interacting with the rickroll, there will be data collected in the background and their display will remain on the rickroll till they perform some type of action that has yet to be determined.

# Anticipated Technologies

We anticipate to use Java as our programming language, GIT as our repository, and HTML for creating the website.

# Method/Approach

We plan on conducting research on how to create a virus and infiltrating other devices. After we feel prepared enough, we will remain in contact with our group in order to deligate tasks and set up meetings to review completed work and address issues that arise. We plan on conducting our project as a team utilizing the Agile Method that was discussed during class. 

# Estimated Timeline

Requirment Analysis & Planning: A Week
Design: 2 Weeks
Coding: A Month
Testing: 2 Weeks

# Anticipated Problems

We anticipate needing to learn and/or refresh on our knowledge of HTML in order to create the website.
